# Question 1 â€“ Min in Sorted Rotated Array

---

## Approach & Logic

We use a **modified binary search** algorithm with the following observations:

- i. If the middle element is greater than the rightmost element, the minimum lies in the **right half**.
- ii. Otherwise, it lies in the **left half** (including `mid`).

We repeat this process until `low == high`, which gives the **index of the minimum element**.

This approach is more efficient than a linear scan (`O(n)`) and leverages the rotated sorted property.

## Time & Space Complexity

| Complexity | Value |
|------------|-------|
| ðŸ•’ Time     | `O(log n)` â€” due to binary search |
| ðŸ§  Space    | `O(1)` â€” constant space used |
